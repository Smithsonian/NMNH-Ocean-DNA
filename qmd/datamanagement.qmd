# Data management workflow

The following is a proposed data management guide for SI Ocean DNA sequence data. This workflow was designed for genome skimming datasets, but could be adapted for other project types. 

::: {.callout-important}
Please see the `README.md` the Ocean DNA Hydra Store directory for details about where to upload raw data and how to name files and directories.

```{mermaid}
graph TD;

  GenoHub[**GenoHub**
Demultiplexed and compressed sequence reads in FASTQ format. Files should end in “.fastq.gz” or “.fq.gz”]
  Metadata[**Metadata CSV**
Information for all samples in the GenoHub project. Must include the following columns:
***ID:*** GenoHub sample name
***R1:*** read 1 FASTQ file name
***R2:*** read 2 FASTQ file name
***Taxon:*** your best guess at taxonomic assignment
***UniqID:*** unique identifier linked to a voucher/tissue sample
  ]
  Analyses(Run quality/adapter trimming, mitogenome assembly, etc)
  Scratch[(**Hydra Scratch**
/scratch/nmnh_ocean_dna
40 TB. Not backed up, no automatic file purging.)]
  Store[(**Hydra Store**
/store/public/oceandna
40 TB. Not backed up, no automatic file purging. For large raw data files and inactive projects. Drive system is slower, can't be used for active analysis)]
  PDrive[(**P Drive**
P:&bsol;NMNH-OCEAN-DNA
80 TB. Incrementally backed up daily, fully backed up weekly. Only accessible from SI computers.)]
  
  Move1[download raw FASTQ files]  
  Move3[copy important results]
  Move4[Dan M. runs monthly and on-demand backup]
